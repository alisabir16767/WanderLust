# Project Title

Welcome to this web application! 🎉 This is a full-stack project built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. It includes user authentication, session management, CRUD operations, and more.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering HTML views
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware
- **method-override**: Allows the use of HTTP methods such as PUT and DELETE in forms
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware to parse cookies
- **express-session**: Session management
- **connect-flash**: Flash messages for notifications
- **connect-mongo**: MongoDB-backed session store

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and session management with Passport.js 🗝️
- **Listings & Reviews**: Create, read, update, and delete listings and reviews 🏙️
- **Session Storage**: Using MongoDB to store user sessions 🌱
- **Flash Messages**: Show success and error messages for better user experience 💬

## 🔧 Installation

To get started with this project, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **MongoDB** installed. If not, install them first. Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```
MONGO_URL=your-mongodb-url
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=8080
```

### 3. Start the Application

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Now the application will be running on `http://localhost:8080`. 🎉

## 🔒 Authentication

This app uses **Passport.js** for user authentication. The `LocalStrategy` is used to authenticate users based on username and password. Sessions are stored in MongoDB using `connect-mongo` for persistent sessions.

### Sign Up & Log In

- Users can sign up and log in to manage listings and reviews.
- Sessions ensure that logged-in users have access to protected routes.

## 🚨 Error Handling

The application uses a custom error handler `ExpressError` to handle errors gracefully.

- **404** - Page Not Found (Custom error page rendered)
- **500** - Internal Server Error (Generic error message)

### ✨ Animations

1. **Loading Spinners**: A loading spinner can be shown while the page loads.

   ```html
   <div class="spinner">
     <div class="spinner-bounce"></div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Button Hover Effect**: Add this CSS to animate buttons when hovered.

   ```css
   .btn {
     transition: all 0.3s ease;
   }
   .btn:hover {
     transform: scale(1.1);
     background-color: #5cb85c;
   }
   ```

3. **Flash Message Fade In**: This CSS can make flash messages appear smoothly:
   ```css
   .flash-message {
     animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in-out;
   }
   @keyframes fadeIn {
     0% {
       opacity: 0;
     }
     100% {
       opacity: 1;
     }
   }
   ```

## 💡 Usage

- Go to `/listings` to view all listings
- Visit `/user/login` to log in and access user-specific features
- Use `/user/signup` to create a new account
