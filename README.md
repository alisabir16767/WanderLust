# WanderLust

Wanderlust is a travel-based platform inspired by Airbnb, where users can browse and book various listings, leave reviews, and manage their profiles. The website allows users to explore different locations, book accommodations, and interact with the community.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering HTML views
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware
- **method-override**: Allows the use of HTTP methods such as PUT and DELETE in forms
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware to parse cookies
- **express-session**: Session management
- **connect-flash**: Flash messages for notifications
- **connect-mongo**: MongoDB-backed session store

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and session management with Passport.js 🗝️
- **Listings & Reviews**: Create, read, update, and delete listings and reviews 🏙️
- **Session Storage**: Using MongoDB to store user sessions 🌱
- **Flash Messages**: Show success and error messages for better user experience 💬

## 🔧 Installation

To get started with this project, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **MongoDB** installed. If not, install them first. Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```
MONGO_URL=your-mongodb-url
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=8080
```

### 3. Start the Application

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Now the application will be running on `http://localhost:8080`. 🎉

## 🔒 Authentication

This app uses **Passport.js** for user authentication. The `LocalStrategy` is used to authenticate users based on username and password. Sessions are stored in MongoDB using `connect-mongo` for persistent sessions.

### Sign Up & Log In

- Users can sign up and log in to manage listings and reviews.
- Sessions ensure that logged-in users have access to protected routes.

## 🚨 Error Handling

The application uses a custom error handler `ExpressError` to handle errors gracefully.

- **404** - Page Not Found (Custom error page rendered)
- **500** - Internal Server Error (Generic error message)



## 💡 Usage

- Go to `/listings` to view all listings
- Visit `/user/login` to log in and access user-specific features
- Use `/user/signup` to create a new account
